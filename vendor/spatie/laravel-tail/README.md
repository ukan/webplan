This package brings back the tail command in Laravel 5. This package works for daily and single logs and has support for tailing local and the remote logs.

Spatie is a webdesign agency in Antwerp, Belgium. You'll find an overview of all our open source projects [on our website](https://spatie.be/opensource).

## Postcardware

You're free to use this package (it's [MIT-licensed](LICENSE.md)), but if it makes it to your production environment you are required to send us a postcard from your hometown, mentioning which of our package(s) you are using.

Our address is: Spatie, Samberstraat 69D, 2060 Antwerp, Belgium.

The best postcards will get published on the open source page on our website.

## Install

You can install the package via composer:

``` bash
composer require spatie/laravel-tail
```
You must install this service provider:
```php
// config/app.php

'providers' => [
    ...
    'Spatie\Tail\TailServiceProvider',
    ...
];
```

If you're planning on tailing remote logs you must publish the config file with this command:
``` bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\Tail\TailServiceProvider"
```
A file named ``tail.php`` will be created in the config directory. The options you can set in the file should be self-explanatory.
```php

return [


    'connections' => [

        /*
         * The environment name. You can use this value in the tail command.
         */
        'production' => [

            /*
             * The hostname of the server where the logs are located
             */
            'host' => '',

            /*
             * The username to be used when connecting to the server where the 
             * logs are located
             */
            'user' => '',

            /*
             * The full path to the directory where the logs are located
             */
            'logDirectory' => '',
        ],
    ],
];

```



## Usage


To tail the local log you can use this command:
``` bash
php artisan tail
```

By default the last 20 lines will be shown. You can change that number by using the ```lines```-option.
``` bash
php artisan tail --lines=50
```

To tail a remote log you must first specify ```hostname``` and ```logDirectory``` in the config-file. After you've done that you can tail the remote logs by specifify the environment as an argument.
``` bash
php artisan tail production
```
